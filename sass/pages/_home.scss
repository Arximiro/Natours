// --- Notes ---
// -20vh in about eliminates the white background under the header from showing in the bottom right corner by moving this section up to cover it.

// Padding is set to 20top/bottom and 0left/right
// Margin is set to -14vh to slide element up behind clip-path.
// In features & > * selects all DIRECT children of section-features. So not children of children.
// The features section in its entirety is skewed by 7 degrees, THEN, all direct children of features are skewed 7 degrees to compensate for that, so they remain level.
// Only direct children are corrected, if all children were then a parent would be skewed by 7, then its child an additional 7 etc.
// It would be possible to just select .row since it's the only direct child, but since it's a re-used class, the direct children only approach prevents any future issues.


// In tours padding is set to 25top 0right 15bottom 0left.
// Element is moved up 17vh to slide behing the clip-path.


// in book there is a lot happening with the background.
// first a linear gradient is created, this gradient is 105deg, this sets the angle of the gradient.
// at 0% the gradient starts with white at a .9 opacity
// then at 50% the gradient is white also with a .9 opacity. This creates pretty much a white to white gradient.
// at 50.1% transparent starts, this allows the rest to be clear. Since transparent is after the 2nd white it takes over for the last 50%.
// *starting transparent at 50.1 instead of 50 helps with a jagged edge glitch all browsers but Firefox seem to experience.
// then the image is set, and it goes behind the gradient.
