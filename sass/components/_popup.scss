// ---Notes---
// The popup itself is given positioning and z-index.
// Essentially the popup is the entire page, that way the black background can be added.
// It's given a high z-index so the black appears on top of everything else.
// It's initially set to hidden and 0 opacity. Opacity must be used to animate, hidden removes it from the flow.
// Then it becomes the target, via the url, it becomes visible.

// The content includes the absCenter mixin to center it within the parent.
// Its width is set to 75%, since the parent element is essentially the entire page.
// Display is set to table to allow for left and right sides to be set to table cell.
// Overflow hidden stops images from overflowing the border radius.
// The transform starts the content at .25 its size. The translate is also added because an element can only have
// one transform set. Since the mixin also sets transform, but the scale is needed, the translate is just repeated here.
// For the transition, the .5s is the duration of the transition, the .2s represents a delay before the animation starts.

// For left, the width is set to 1/3 of the parent element, and display is set to table-cell
// This allows content to appear as it might in a table cell.

// For right, the width is set to 2/3 and the display is also set to tabel cell.
// This represents the right side of the popup that has the text.
// Vertical align centers the text vertically within the table cell.
// Padding gives the text some breathing room from the images.

// The images are set to display block and width 99% to fill up the parent container.
// With 100% there is a weird bar under the bottom image, 99% remedies that.

// For the text the font size is set, and some margin between the text and the button.
// Column count splits the element into 2 columns, and then the space between columns is set.
// Column rule represents the line in between the columns.
// Hypyens is a newer CSS property that places hypens after words if they finish on a new line.
// This currently doesn't work on Opera and Chrome in Windows.

// :target and __content is for when the popup is the target, the content becomes visible and
// transforms to its full scale.

// The close link is styled and positioned in the top right of its parent element.
// Text by default has a line height of one, so setting it to 0 removes that to allow better placement.
// When hovered the X becomes green.
